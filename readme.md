## Power IR-LEDs driver 
The project consists of 3 similar PCBs. Each of them has 2 LZ1-00R802 diodes. One also has a buck converter that serves as a LED driver for all 3 PCBs. They are daisy-chained into one circuit in order to attach them to a digital microscope, using which we can see through sillicon and observe chip structures.
